<!-- INSTRUCTIONS

1. refactor the article declarations to make them apply to a single parent container
2. combine selectors that have the same properties using a comma delimited list, then override that declaration using individual definitions
3. refactor the paragraph properties to use shorthand syntax
4. make the nav list items display horizontally using display: inline. give them right and left margins of 5px (don't forget to use shorthand!)
5. center the nav items, use shorthand syntax where appropriate

        <h1>History of Sven's</h1>
        <p>Sven's Snowshoe Emporium was founded in 1989 by Sven Jacobssen, a man with a passion for trudging through unsafe surfaces. Since the time he was a small child, Sven dreamed of building an emporium to house the magical shoes that made his hobby possible. Believing in supporting his small community, and fearing travel, it only made sense to build this snowshoe mecca in his hometown of Wenatchee, Washington. Since 1989, Sven's has grown tremendously, drawing snow enthusiasts from across the nation and worldwide.</p>
        <p>Today, Sven's is operated by Sven and his 4 daughters, Sofia, Sassa, Solvig, and Svanhilda. Stop by anytime Monday thru Saturday from 9am to 6pm, and join the Sven's Snowshoe Emporium family.</p>

        <h1>What Makes Our Snowshoes Different</h1>
        <p>Sven's shoes are made from 100% genuine imported organic bamboo frames and locally-produced antimicrobial neoprene laces, forming the strongest snowshoe in the world. These mighty shoes are backed by a limited 10-year warranty, so you can exchange your pair for any reason, no questions asked *.</p>  
        <p class="disclaimer">* Sven's snowshoe warranty does not cover bear attacks.</p>
